/// \section whatisgears What is Gears?
/// Gears is a collection of utilities (henceforth now called "modules") that are helpful to C++11 programmers.
/// These include a large collection of modules ranging from the string module to the functional module.
/// 
/// \section compilersupport Compiler Support
/// Since Gears makes heavy use of C++11 features, only the compilers with the most support for C++11 are supported. At the
/// time of this writing, this only includes GCC 4.8.1 or higher and Clang 3.4 or higher. Visual Studio 2012 or lower are 
/// not supported at all, and you might get lucky with some modules on Visual Studio 2013 although not explicitly supported.

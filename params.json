{"name":"Gears","tagline":"C++ Utilities","body":"## Gears\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Rapptz/Gears.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Rapptz/Gears)\r\n\r\nGears is a header-only library that offers utilities for C++11 programmers. This is a plan to remake the [original library][1] \r\nhosted at Bitbucket. The [issue tracker][2] will be used to keep track of things I plan to remake until I'm satisfied initially.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://bitbucket.org/Rapptz/gears\r\n[2]: https://github.com/Rapptz/Gears/issues?milestone=1&state=open\r\n\r\n## Compiler Support\r\n\r\nCurrently Gears targets compilers that have good support of C++11 features, at the moment these include Clang 3.4 and GCC 4.8\r\nor higher. Visual Studio 2013 could have worked in theory but it isn't technically supported and any bugs are a side effect.\r\n\r\nNo extraneous libraries are required to use Gears, only the standard library.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

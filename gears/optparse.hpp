/**
 * @defgroup optparse Option parsing module
 * @brief Provides a method of parsing command line arguments.
 *
 * @details This module is a way to parse command line arguments using
 * conventional POSIX/Unix standards. It is a more convenient and flexible
 * way of parsing command line options compared to rolling your own by hand.
 * This module has built-in support for subcommands so you could make your own
 * git-like programs with e.g. `git commit` and `git add`. This module is mainly
 * inspired by Python's `optparse` library and Boost.ProgramOptions.

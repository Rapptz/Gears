## Gears

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Rapptz/Gears.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Rapptz/Gears)

Gears is a header-only library that offers utilities for C++11 programmers. This is a plan to remake the [original library][1] 
hosted at Bitbucket. The [issue tracker][2] will be used to keep track of things I plan to remake until I'm satisfied initially.

## Compiler Support

Currently Gears targets compilers that have good support of C++11 features, at the moment these include Clang 3.4 and GCC 4.8
or higher. Visual Studio 2013 could have worked in theory but it isn't technically supported and any bugs are a side effect.

No extraneous libraries are required to use Gears, only the standard library.
